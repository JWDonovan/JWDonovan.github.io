So glad you could stop by to check out my new blog and see my first ever post! Like all those who start a blog, I have big plans for what I want it to be about. But first,let's start with a welcome. My name is James and I plan to introduce myself properly in my [next post](https://jwdonovan.github.io/howdy_internet_nice_to_meet_ya). Before I do that, I want to set some expectations of what I, as a writer, want for this blog and what you, as a reader, might see if you decide to stick around.

First and foremost this blog will be about technology -- specifically programming and all things computer-related. I am currently studying software engineering to become a professional web developer and many of the posts on this blog will serve to document my journey along this path. Also, because programming has been a long time hobby and passion for me, I simply enjoy learning and writing about the topic and I hope you will enjoy reading about it.

I hope this blog will also give me an opportunity to express myself and let people get a chance to know me. I want this blog to be a public reflection of me. A resource that I can point people towards to get a sense of who I am and how I think.

As a long-time Linux user and fan, I also have a love for open-source software and the community around it. I have been on the outskirts of this community, profitting from their knowledge and hard work, but I've not been able to contribute and give back as much as I would like. I want that to change! I want this blog to be a way for me to give back some of the knowledge I have gained over the years. Even if only one person learns something while reading this blog, all the work put into its making will have been worth it.

Thanks again for taking the time to read my first post. I hope you stick around and hear more of what I have to say.
